## SCRIPTING S3

# The AWS Simple Storage Service (S3) provides object storage similar to a file system. 
# Folders are represented as buckets and the contents of the buckets are known as keys. 
# Of course, all of these objects can be managed with Python and the boto3 library.

## LIST BUCKETS AND THEIR CONTENTS

# Our first S3 script will let us see what buckets currently exist in our account and any keys inside those buckets.
# Of course, we’ll import the boto3 library. Then we can create an S3 resource. 
# Remember, this gives us a handle to all of the functions provided by the S3 console. 
# We can then use the resource to iterate over all buckets. 
# For each bucket, we print the name of the bucket and then iterate over all the objects inside that bucket. 
# For each object, we print the object’s key or essentially the object’s name. The code looks like this:

#!/usr/bin/env python
import boto3
s3 = boto3.resource('s3')
for bucket in s3.buckets.all():
    print bucket.name
    print "---"
    for item in bucket.objects.all():
        print "\t%s" % item.key
